RELEASE NOTES - MIFCONV v3.2.2
RELEASED 28th April 2010 

SUPPORTS S60 3.2+

===============================================================================

Product Description:
====================
Mifconv is a Multi-Icon File (MIF) converter tool for generating MIF, MBM and 
MBG header files from SVGB, SVG and BMP sources. It can be called directly 
from the command line or from the PRJ_EXTENSIONS block in a component's 
bld.inf file, utilizing makefile templates during the build process.

Main Features:
==============
- Command line interface for calling Mifconv from custom makefiles
- Makefile templates for incremental building, supporting GNU make syntax for
  ABLD build system and FLM syntax for SBSv2 build system
- Generating MIF files from SVG/SVGB icon sources and BMP file ids
- Converting SVG to SVGB with the Svgtbinencode utility
- Generating MBM files (alternatively with Bmconv utility given with -B parameter)
- Generating icon id enumeration MBG header files from the given source files

===============================================================================

What's New in v3.2.2
====================
- Fix: Mifconv now support the marking ".\" in front of a filename in Linux.
- Fix: Mifconv now compiles correctly in Linux.

===============================================================================

Installation Notes:
===================
Mifconv is pre-installed in an SDK environment and does not contain any 
Symbian software counterparts. 

===============================================================================

System Requirements:
====================
Basic Requirements:
- Any S60 3.2 or higher RnD environment

===============================================================================

Compatibility Issues:
=====================
N/A

===============================================================================

Known Issues:
=============
- There must not be any spaces in a path given with -B parameter
- Depth parameter must always be given for each bitmap
- Heavier components, such as avkon2.mif, are not supported in ABLD build
  system due to restrictions in GNU make in the SDK
- If you don't specify TARGETFILE in the bld.inf at all but only a HEADERFILE,
  the MBM file will be generated to the header file directory 

===============================================================================

Version History:
================

Version 3.2.1 - 20th April 2010
====================
- Change: Added new default search directories for icon files.

Version 3.2.0 - 24th February 2010
====================
- Change: Removed dependencies to BMCONV tool by adding the BMCONV encoding 
  functionality as a part of MifConv functionality. External BMCONV tool can still 
  be used by giving -B parameter.

Version 3.1.7 - 10th July 2009
====================
- Fix: MIF-file is created also when no input files are given.
- Fix: Correct build directory used with mifconv.flm.
- Fix: MBM-file is included in RELEASABLES macro in mifconv.flm.
- Fix: '/' is not a valid option prefix in Linux. Only '-' is allowed.
- Change: If SBS_BUILD_DIR environment variable is defined, it is used as 
  a base of temporary icon folder.

Version 3.1.6 - 22nd June 2009
------------------------------
- Fix: Mifconv.xml updated to schema version 2.0

Version 3.1.5 - 30th April 2009
-------------------------------
- Fix: Supressed most of the "overriding commands for target..." warnings 
  when using mifconv.flm and parallel building.
- Fix: When using mifconv.flm, svg conversion fails because of unsufficient
  file access rights after copying the svg files to intermediate directory.

Version 3.1.4 - 17th April 2009 
-------------------------------
- Fix: Directory separators in EPOCROOT environment variable and source-
  directories fixed in mifconv.exe. In some cases there were mixed '/' and '\'
  characters in a path.
- Change: Intermediate directory for SVGB files is unique for target component.
  For example: For target myicons.mif, intermediate directory would be:
  <EPOCROOT>/epoc32/build/s60/icons/myicons/
- Fix: No error returned if mifconv.exe cannot remove mif- or mbm-files. Only
  a warning is printed to debug log.
- Fix: Info statements were not well-formed in mifconv.flm.

Version 3.1.3 - 9th March 2009
------------------------------
- Fix: Removed comments corrupting SBS build log in mifconv.flm
- Change: Mifconv.flm uses GNURM tool instead of RM.

Version 3.1.2 - 20th February 2009
----------------------------------
- Fix: Dependency on mask files added to mifconv.flm. 
- Fix: Parameter file given to mifconv.exe was generated wrongly when header 
file parameter was not used with makefile templates.
- Fix: Mifconv crashed if the file was locked in error situation. 
- Fix: Mifconv svg conversion failed when EPOCROOT environment variable did
not end with directory separator.

Version 3.1.1 - 6th February 2009
---------------------------------
- Fix: If the header file to be generated is already in use, no error is returned
  anymore. Instead a warning shown. 
- Fix: mifconv and svgtbinencode executable name resolution fixed in mifconv.flm.
- Change: MIFCONVDEBUG parameter added to mifconv.xml
- Change: TOOLCAT, TOOLCOPY and TOOLMKDIR parameters added to mifconv.xml
- Change: MIFCONVDEBUG parameter taken into use in mifconv.flm
- Change: ABLD -what target handling added in mifconv.flm

Version 3.0.0 - 14th November 2008
----------------------------------
- Change: Mifconv Extension templates are now a part of normal Mifconv package 
- Feature: Custom input directories can be given with -i parameter
- Feature: SVGB binary files can be given as input
- Feature: Mifconv can be compiled and used in Linux environment
- Fix: Bmconv is no longer executed from makefile templates, but always from
